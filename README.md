# Belly_Button_Diversity

## Purpose
Bacteria lives on every part of the human body, and in this analysis samples were taken from participants belly buttons to explore what types of bacteria exist on that part of the body.  Data such as general participant information, participants ID numbers, and bacterial colony findings were stored in a .json file.  This file was used to visualize participant metadata, the amount and type of bacteria found in samples, and the participants' self reported number of belly button washes per week.  A dashboard containing multiple charts was created using Javascript, Plotly, and HTML.  The dashboard was designed to be dynamic, such that when a participant's ID number is chosen from a dropdown menu, the charts will change based on that participant's particular belly button data.  Stylistic changes to the dashboard were done with CSS to make it more visually appealing.
